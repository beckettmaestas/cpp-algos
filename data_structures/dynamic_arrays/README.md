# Dynamic Arrays

One of the most useful methods for storing data is the dynamic array. Almost all programs will use the dynamic array in some form or another and many more complex data structures will rely on dynamic arrays to store information in a manner which can be easily accessed. Fortunately, C++ has built in support for dynamic arrays using the vector class. This section will focus on some examples where the dynamic array can be used for storing many different types of data.

## Dynamic Integer Array
The example shown in this section uses a vector to build a resizable array of integers which are specified on the command line when the program is run. It is important to remember that the vector class can take any type at compile-time, including classes which we create. This makes it a very useful container for objects, data, and other data structures. We will see many more examples of this in further modules of this course so gaining familiarity with the C++vector class is a very useful thing to practice.
