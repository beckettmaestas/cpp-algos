# Dynamic Arrays

One of the most useful methods for storing data is the dynamic array. Almost all programs will use the dynamic array in some form or another and many more complex data structures will rely on dynamic arrays to store information in a manner which can be easily accessed. Fortunately, C++ has built in support for dynamic arrays using the vector class. This section will focus on some examples where the dynamic array can be used for storing many different types of data.
