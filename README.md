# Basic Algorithm and Data Structure Course

This is a basic course for exploring and using data structures and algorithms in C++. The primary purpose of this repo is to serve as a place to reference the most common algorithms and data structures, learn new approaches to understanding these topics, and to provide practice examples for using these data structures and algorithms.
